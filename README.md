# Biochemical Data and Cognitive Test Raw Data

This repository contains the raw data from our study investigating the effects of environmentally relevant CO2 exposure and activation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and its impact on cognitive function in humans. The data includes results from Seahorse assays and cognitive assessments (Strategic Management Simulation (SMS) test) conducted on human subjects.

## Study Overview

This study aims to elucidate the biochemical pathways linking CO2 exposure to cognitive decline in humans.

## Data Structure

The Excel sheet titled **"EHP_Human CO2_Biochemical and Cognitive Data.xlsx"** includes the following columns:
