Biochemical Data and Cognitive Test Raw Data
This repository contains the raw data from our study investigating the effects of environmentally relevant CO2 exposure and activation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and its impact on cognitive function in humans. The data includes results from Seahorse assays and cognitive assessments conducted on human subjects.
Study Overview
This study aims to elucidate the biochemical pathways linking CO2 exposure to cognitive decline in humans.
